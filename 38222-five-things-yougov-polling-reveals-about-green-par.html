the Green Party of England and Wales due to elect its new leaders later this month, a new YouGov poll of 605 current members investigates the views of its members across a range of different issues.</p><h3>Outgoing leaders Sian Berry and Jonathan Bartley regarded highly by members, but Caroline Lucas more popular</h3><p>Sian Berry and Jonathon Bartley’s reign as co-leaders ended in July when Bartley stepped down, with Berry staying on as acting leader until later this month. Reflecting on their three-year stint, Green members are generally positive, with nine in ten (92%) saying as a pair they’ve well, including 34% who think they’ve performed “very well”.</p><p>The Green co-leaders are viewed positively individually too, with 87% having a favourable opinion of Bartley (including 42% “very favourable”) and 91% having a positive view of Berry (including 49% “very favourable”).</p><p>The Green Party’s sole MP and former leader, Caroline Lucas, is viewed favourably by 96% of members. What is particularly impressive about Lucas’s numbers, though, is that 84% view her “very” favourably.</p><p>Looking at views of other parties’ leaders, just 8% of Green party members have a favourable view of Boris Johnson, with 93% having an unfavourable view (including 88% who say “very unfavourable”). Keir Starmer is viewed more favourably, but proves divisive: 52% of Green members have a positive view of him compared to 46% who view him unfavourably. He is, however, less popular among Greens than his predecessor: Jeremy Corbyn is seen favourably by 63% to 36%.</p><h3>Green members would be happy to enter a coalition with Labour, but would also be pleased with a Labour majority</h3><p>A coalition including the Green Party in Germany looks like a very real possibility as the general election there approaches. Here in the UK, there is strong appetite amongst Green Party members to enter a coalition government if the opportunity were to arise. Over eight in ten (84%) would either be delighted (41%) or pleased (43%) if a Labour-Green coalition were to happen at the next election. There is also strong support for a coalition government with Labour and the SNP (79%).</p><p>Half of Green members (51%) would even be happy with a Labour majority government at the next election, with 31% not really minding this outcome and just one in five saying they’d be disappointed (14%) or dismayed (4%). This is perhaps in part due to their hostility toward the Conservatives. Almost all members (93%) say they would be dismayed (84%) or disappointed (9%) if the Tories were to remain in power after this election cycle, with just 2% saying they’d be happy with this outcome.</p><p>There is also very little appetite amongst Green members for the Conservatives being their party’s route to government. Just 8% would be pleased with a Conservative-Green coalition; 78% say they’d be disappointed or dismayed.</p><h3>It’s the environment, stupid</h3><p>It will come as little surprise that the environment (86%) tops the list of the most important issues Green Party members see as facing the country, followed by health (52%) and Brexit (41%). By contrast, just 31% of the general public consider the environment a top issue, which puts it in fourth place overall.</p><p>Compared to the wider public, Green members are much more likely to see Brexit (41% vs 26%) and housing (23% to 15%) as a main concern, and less likely to list the economy (16% to 38%), immigration (9% to 35%), defence (4% to 12%) and crime (2% to 14%).</p><p>While its clear the environment is the top concern for members, they do not feel the Greens should be a single issue party. Just 17% think it should focus its time and energy just on the environment and climate change, compared to four in five (79%) who think it is important to offer a wide range of policies across different areas.</p><h3>Climate change needs to be prioritised now, but Green members have little faith that COP26 will result in significant action</h3><p>When it comes to tackling climate change, Green members are much more likely to favour urgent action than the public overall. Nine in ten (90%) think it should be a top priority now in terms of government spending, even if cuts are needed elsewhere, compared to just 3% who think there are other more important spending priorities. The British public split 43% to 31% on this trade off.</p><p>Looking at specific policies to tackle climate change, 92% of members support the banning of petrol and diesel cars, a policy already due to come into force in 2030. The wider population are split on this policy, with 44% supporting it compared to 45% opposed.</p><p>There is also support amongst many Green members for more extreme policies to tackle climate change. A majority (55%) would support banning all air travel for leisure purposes, while members only marginally oppose banning the sale of all meat and dairy products (50% oppose, 45% support). In contrast, British adults oppose banning air travel for leisure by 73% to 17% and oppose banning meat and diary by 82% to 10%.</p><p>Given the high levels of support for banning meat, it is unsurprising that Green party members are far more likely to be vegan (16%) or vegetarian (18%) than the British public overall (2% and 5%, respectively).</p><p>Green members are far more aware of the COP26 UN Climate Conference taking place in November than the general public, with 79% saying they have heard a great deal or a fair amount about it compared to 23% of Brits. They do align with the public when it comes to their pessimism about the overall outcomes though, with 77% saying it is unlikely to result in any significant action being taken (63% of the public say the same).</p><h3>Green members back the actions of Extinction Rebellion far more than the public</h3><p>Extinction Rebellion co-founder and current candidate for Green party leader, Tamsin Omond, will likely be pleased to hear that four in five (80%) of Green Party members support the campaigning methods of the activism group when it comes to climate change, with just 7% opposing them. This is in complete contrast to the general public, who oppose the organisation’s methods by 52% to 11%.</p><p>Members also trust the organisation on the environment in general by 88% to 10%, though not as much as they trust the Green Party (97% to 3%). The Labour Party are trusted on the environment by 47% of Green members, although slightly more 52% say they do not trust the party.</p><p><strong>See full results <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnY21%2Fc36Mn6CvnV2ptaq6xqxksqelnLy3ec%2Boo6Whnpx6s7HVnpilq12Wr7DB02aeq52Vo3qxrdE%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./for-the-first-time-gabrielle-union-addresses-agt-and-simon-cowell-on-camera-video.html>&#171;&nbsp;For The First Time, Gabrielle Union Addresses 'AGT' And Simon Cowell On Camera [VIDEO]</a>
