Relationships are built on trust; it is difficult to build trust with an insincere person. You can say all the sweet words in this word, but sincerity does not necessarily have to be couched in romantic words.<p class=align-left>At the same time, she warns that it’s important for women especially to be wary of sweet talkers as sincerity is more in action than words.</p>No matter how sweet your words are, it is your actions and attitude that will tell me how genuine you are.
