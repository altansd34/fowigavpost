There is a high chance that they are using you for their own purposes.</li><li><strong>A lot of drama and gossip: </strong>Does the person like gossiping about others behind their back, and being too invasive in other people's private life? You may not realize it, but trusting them might be detrimental since they will do the same thing to you one day.</li><li><strong>Constant criticism: </strong>Someone who really cares about you will support and encourage you, not make you feel bad about yourself. If this person always criticizes everything about you or makes fun of you, then the friendship is toxic and needs to be stopped.</li><li><strong>They are never happy for you: </strong>If the person cannot be genuinely happy for you, and possibly starts being jealous and competitive when you share some good news, this is definitely a red flag.</li><li><strong>They break promises: </strong>Sure, everyone has a life of their own, and sometimes stuff can get in the way of plans. However, if the person constantly disappears, makes excuses, and does not keep their promises, perhaps you should re-evaluate your relationship with them.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b79d6396d03c67b8.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50 fake people quotes that everyone can relate to</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/03126a5bec4472e2.jpg><ul><li><strong>They are quiet when you get mistreated: </strong>Quite often, especially in group environments such as at school, in college, or at the workplace, you may encounter bullies. A person who cares about you will always have your back and never let someone treat you this way, but a fake friend will not.</li><li><strong>They are untrustworthy: </strong>Have you ever shared a secret with someone, just to learn later that they could not keep their mouth shut? You should be really careful around such people and not share anything personal with them.</li><li><strong>They use you as an emotional outlet: </strong>Some people expect everyone to listen to their problems and console them, without giving anything in return. If you have someone in your life who complains all the time and does not want to work on their issues, maybe it is time you put yourself first and let them go.</li><li><strong>Zero tolerance to other people's opinions: </strong>It is tiring to be around a person who always wants to prove that they are right. If you find yourself constantly arguing with this person and it wears you out, you should probably think about whether the friendship worth it.</li><li><strong>They pressure you into doing things you do not want:</strong> If they do not respect your wishes and desires, then it may not be a healthy companionship.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/72f36d71bf7d7ad1.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>When to say I love you to your significant other - choosing the right time</span></p></a><h2>How to deal with fake friends</h2><p class=align-left>There are a few ways of dealing with a relationship that is not beneficial to you.
