He&nbsp;ended things because he&nbsp;didn’t see a&nbsp;future with her, but everyone around him was shocked because she’s so&nbsp;good and beautiful.</p><p>Then we&nbsp;met, and&nbsp;I soon understood that everyone from his side preferred her. I&nbsp;even heard some call me&nbsp;the Camilla, although I&nbsp;am neither much older nor less attractive (in&nbsp;my&nbsp;opinion, I&nbsp;love how&nbsp;I look even if&nbsp;I don’t tick all of&nbsp;the beauty boxes like tall, blonde, blue eyes, etc like his&nbsp;ex).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/18e/5b1/5cae01574a85777238cfbe4dfa.jpg><p>He&nbsp;never gave me&nbsp;any reason to&nbsp;doubt him, however. He&nbsp;gave me&nbsp;the impression that he&nbsp;knew exactly what he&nbsp;wanted. Was secure enough in&nbsp;his heart that he&nbsp;told me&nbsp;he&nbsp;loved me&nbsp;a&nbsp;few months into our relationship, and&nbsp;I never felt like he&nbsp;was lying or&nbsp;that&nbsp;I wasn’t enough.</p><p>He&nbsp;is&nbsp;fully aware of&nbsp;what people think about him leaving his&nbsp;ex, and he&nbsp;gave the impression that he&nbsp;thought they were silly and childish. He&nbsp;told his mom that&nbsp;I was who he&nbsp;had chosen and if&nbsp;she wanted a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;it, she needed to&nbsp;clean up&nbsp;her act.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3eb/c75/5d3395514584dd606d3919afdf.jpg><p>We&nbsp;got married 3&nbsp;years ago and only now&nbsp;I found out that he&nbsp;went on&nbsp;a&nbsp;date with his&nbsp;ex, a&nbsp;few days before our wedding. He&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;know for sure that she wasn’t like everyone around him thought, the one who got away. He&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;make 100% sure.</p><p>His mom told me&nbsp;gleefully when she visited our new baby, and she looked at&nbsp;my&nbsp;daughter and said she wondered what would have happened if&nbsp;he&nbsp;changed his mind after that date, and she was visiting their baby now. My&nbsp;husband and the one who got away. With a&nbsp;sigh but gleefully. You know what I&nbsp;mean.</p><p>I&nbsp;haven’t spoken to&nbsp;him for a&nbsp;week, and&nbsp;I hate silent treatment, but&nbsp;I just can’t talk to&nbsp;him. It&nbsp;isn’t something I&nbsp;am doing to&nbsp;punish him. Or&nbsp;manipulate him. Or&nbsp;get the upper hand and control him. I&nbsp;just can’t look at&nbsp;him or&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;him.</p><p><h2>People stood on&nbsp;her side.</h2></p><ul><li>"Your husband is a jerk, but your mother-in-law loathes you.
