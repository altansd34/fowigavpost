But true <a href=# title=movie data-link=tag>movie</a> fans know him as&nbsp;the one who played Oskar Schindler. However, today we’re not here to&nbsp;talk about his successful film career but about the tragic side of&nbsp;the actor’s life. In&nbsp;2009, due to&nbsp;an&nbsp;unfortunate accident, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lost</a> his beloved wife and has since not chosen to&nbsp;connect his fate with anyone else, instead devoting himself to&nbsp;work and his children.</p><p>Liam and Natasha, 2008</p><p>The <a href=# title="love story" data-link=tag>love story</a> of&nbsp;the Irish actor and the English actress began when they starred together in&nbsp;the play <i>Anna Christie</i> on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Broadway data-link=tag>Broadway</a> in&nbsp;1993. At&nbsp;the time, 29-year-old Natasha Richardson was married to&nbsp;producer Robert Fox but was already in&nbsp;the process of&nbsp;getting a&nbsp;<a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a>. Although Liam was known as&nbsp;a&nbsp;ladies’ man at&nbsp;the time, his reputation did not affect Natasha. “I’m pleased that women fall in&nbsp;love with him, because&nbsp;I know why,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p>Richardson <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fell</a> deeply in&nbsp;love with Neeson, who considered himself a&nbsp;confirmed bachelor. In&nbsp;one interview, Liam <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I’d never had that kind of&nbsp;an&nbsp;explosive chemistry situation with an&nbsp;actor, or&nbsp;actress.” They tied the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>knot</a> in&nbsp;1994&nbsp;on a&nbsp;small farm in&nbsp;the northern part of&nbsp;New York state. “I&nbsp;can’t believe&nbsp;I was lucky enough to&nbsp;meet my&nbsp;soul mate,” Richardson later <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d8c/f03/ea51ea5cb798527920735d6403.jpg><p>PHOTOlink / Everett Collection / East News</p><p>Liam and Natasha, 1993.</p><p>In&nbsp;that same year, they starred together in&nbsp;the movie <i>Nell</i>. In&nbsp;1995, they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>welcomed</a> their first son, Michael. The next year, their second son, Daniel, was born.</p><p>Natasha with her sons, 2008.</p><p>Their relationship was wonderful, and they were an&nbsp;example for other celebrity couples. But everything was shattered by&nbsp;a&nbsp;terrible tragedy that occurred in&nbsp;March 2009. Richardson <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sustained</a> a&nbsp;head injury while skiing without a&nbsp;helmet on&nbsp;a&nbsp;beginner’s trail in&nbsp;the Canadian city of&nbsp;Quebec. At&nbsp;first, the actress did not attach much importance to&nbsp;the injury because she did not feel anything serious. “We&nbsp;spoke to&nbsp;her, and she just said, ’Oh, darling, I’ve taken a&nbsp;tumble in&nbsp;the snow,’” Neeson <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a> in&nbsp;2014.</p><p>But a&nbsp;few hours later, she suddenly became <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ill</a>, lost consciousness, and fell into a&nbsp;coma. She was taken to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=hospital data-link=tag>hospital</a> in&nbsp;Montreal. And Liam, who was filming the movie <i>Chloe</i> in&nbsp;Toronto at&nbsp;the time, immediately flew to&nbsp;the hospital to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with his wife. When the actor arrived at&nbsp;his beloved’s side (just a&nbsp;few hours after the accident), the doctors told him that Richardson’s brain was already dead and she was on&nbsp;life support.</p><p>It&nbsp;turned out that the actress had suffered a&nbsp;fatal head injury. When the doctors showed Neeson the X-ray of&nbsp;Natasha’s brain, he&nbsp;understood <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>everything</a>, “Sweetie, you’re not coming back from this. I&nbsp;don’t know if&nbsp;you can hear&nbsp;me, but what’s happened has happened. And we’re bringing you back to&nbsp;New York. Your whole <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> and friends are coming.”</p><p>After the funeral, the actor said that he&nbsp;and Natasha had previously made an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>agreement</a>: if&nbsp;one of&nbsp;them ever fell into a&nbsp;vegetative state, the other would turn off life support systems. “So&nbsp;when&nbsp;I saw her, saw all these tubes, I&nbsp;immediately remembered the agreement.” In&nbsp;the end, Natasha <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>donated</a> 3&nbsp;of&nbsp;her organs (heart, kidneys, and liver), thus saving the lives of&nbsp;3&nbsp;people.</p><p>Liam and Natasha, 2005</p><p>To&nbsp;cope with his grief, Liam Neeson immersed himself in&nbsp;work (since 2009, he&nbsp;has appeared in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>almost</a> 50&nbsp;films) and dedicated himself to&nbsp;raising his sons. At&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;their mother’s death, they were only 12&nbsp;and 13&nbsp;years old. “I&nbsp;just don’t&nbsp;— I&nbsp;just don’t wallow too much. You know? And I&nbsp;just didn’t want to&nbsp;— especially for my&nbsp;boys&nbsp;— seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;wallowing in&nbsp;sadness or&nbsp;depression,” the actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a>.</p><p>However, Neeson found it&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;terms with the loss of&nbsp;his beloved. In&nbsp;one interview, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that even 13&nbsp;years after Natasha’s death, when he&nbsp;hears the front door open, he&nbsp;still expects his wife to&nbsp;walk in&nbsp;and hear her voice, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the sound of&nbsp;her keys being thrown on&nbsp;the table.</p><p>Some scenes in&nbsp;the movies he&nbsp;appears in&nbsp;remind him of&nbsp;his loss. “And, then, it’s&nbsp;— grief’s like&nbsp;— it&nbsp;hits you. It’s like a&nbsp;wave. You just get this profound feeling of&nbsp;instability. You feel like a&nbsp;3-legged <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>table</a>. Just suddenly, you just&nbsp;— the Earth isn’t stable anymore. And then it&nbsp;passes and becomes more infrequent, but&nbsp;I still get it&nbsp;sometimes,” the actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4c5/c29/61542459b0bf4ae7a978db674f.jpg><p>AFP / EAST NEWS</p><p>Liam and Natasha, 2008</p><p>Neeson misses his wife so&nbsp;much&nbsp;— she is&nbsp;always on&nbsp;his mind.

It’s like you’ve just done that in&nbsp;your chest.”</p><p>He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adds</a>, “Tasha, she’s buried up&nbsp;near our house. Her grandmother too.

After Natasha Richardson’s death, Neeson’s mother-in-law, actress Vanessa Redgrave, was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>involved</a> in&nbsp;raising the children. Neeson says that his family is&nbsp;in&nbsp;good hands. “I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;great support team. And if&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;away on&nbsp;a&nbsp;project, my&nbsp;mother-in-law moves in&nbsp;with&nbsp;us,” the actor said.</p><p>Vanessa Redgrave with her grandkids, 2010</p><p>Liam has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>talked</a> about how he&nbsp;often dreams of&nbsp;his late wife being alive to&nbsp;witness their sons growing&nbsp;up, gaining muscle mass, and exploring dangerous paths. He&nbsp;wishes that she could share this experience with their sons. Additionally, the actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>noted</a> that he&nbsp;used to&nbsp;constantly worry about his boys getting addicted to&nbsp;harmful habits that could permanently change their lives and family.</p><p>At&nbsp;the same time, Liam assures that he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>trusts</a> his children because they are smart boys. The actor is&nbsp;very proud of&nbsp;his sons and notes that they know their dad will always be&nbsp;there for them no&nbsp;matter what.</p><p>Liam with his sons, 2011</p><p>Having come of&nbsp;age, Liam’s eldest son, with his father’s blessing, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>took</a> his mother’s last name, officially becoming Michael Richardson. He&nbsp;simply wanted to&nbsp;feel his mother close to&nbsp;him, as&nbsp;she was a&nbsp;fantastic woman. By&nbsp;the way, Michael followed in&nbsp;his parents’ footsteps, starting a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>career</a> in&nbsp;Hollywood, although his father was initially against&nbsp;it.</p><p>Liam with his son Michael, 2015</p><p>Liam and Natasha’s younger son also tried his hand in&nbsp;the entertainment industry, studying acting and digital media. He&nbsp;worked behind the scenes several times, producing films, but eventually <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>switched</a> to&nbsp;fashion. In&nbsp;2017, he&nbsp;launched his own line of&nbsp;eco-friendly clothing called Pine Outfitters.</p><p>Liam with his sons Daniel (center) and Michael (on&nbsp;the right), 2014</p><p>After his wife’s death, Liam Neeson never found a&nbsp;woman whom he&nbsp;could love as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;he&nbsp;loved Natasha Richardson. Although he&nbsp;had several brief flings, they never turned into serious relationships.</p><p>In&nbsp;2016, Liam <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> a&nbsp;message with fans in&nbsp;which he&nbsp;remembered his late wife. He&nbsp;urged everyone to&nbsp;cherish their partners and make the most of&nbsp;every day together. He&nbsp;wrote, “Because, one day, when you look up&nbsp;from your phone, they won’t be&nbsp;there anymore.
