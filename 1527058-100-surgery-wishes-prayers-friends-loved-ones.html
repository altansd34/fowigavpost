Here's what he shared:</p><ul><li>In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him and said unto him, 'Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.' Then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the LORD, saying, 'I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight.' And Hezekiah wept sore. And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying, 'Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD. And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.' And Isaiah said, 'Take a lump of figs.' And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovere - <i>2 Kings 20:1-7</i></li><li>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people. And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them - <i>Matthew 4:23-25</i></li><li>When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick - <i>Matthew 8:16</i></li><li>‭‭But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd. - <i>Matthew‬ ‭9:36‬</i> ‭</li><li>Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever - <i>Hebrews 13:8</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/aabfa1132606ae7a.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>75+ gone too soon rest in peace quotes about unexpected death</span></p></a><h2>Best wishes for a surgery</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b37310aff92af8a3.jpg><p class=align-left>Here are wishing you successful surgery messages and wishes you can share with anyone yet to undergo surgery.</p><ul><li>The good Lord will see you through.</li><li>This procedure will be long done before you know it.</li><li>I'll be praying for you and your medical team.</li><li>I'm sending you all the positive energy during this trying time.</li><li>You have to survive this!
