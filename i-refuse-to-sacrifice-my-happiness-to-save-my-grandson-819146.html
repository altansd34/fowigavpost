Blackmailing the grandmother with "you'll never see us again" is horrible. This lady has one foot in the grave and wants to spend some time with her sister before she can't and she never ask them to give her money for this trip, (I'm pretty sure she's done a lot for them to where that would even be a reasonable request) but now that they've run into some money problems they not only expect her to just hand it over, they threaten her with "withholding love"??? What is that? Go get a lone from the bank, and let grandmom go on a trip with her sister.</p><p>Betty, thank you for sharing your story with&nbsp;us. We&nbsp;have some tips that we&nbsp;hope can be&nbsp;helpful to&nbsp;you.</p><p><h2>Open a&nbsp;dialogue with your son.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/154/42e/92f93b5a7e884ce4aeb6231ca5.jpg><p>I can't believe that a grandma wouldn't help her grand child.</p><p>Approach your son with <strong>a </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>calm</strong></a><strong> and open heart</strong>, seeking to understand his perspective. Explain your feelings and the importance of the trip to you, but also <strong>listen to his concerns</strong> about his son's health.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Acknowledge</strong></a><strong> the emotional stress he is under</strong> and express your desire to find a <a href=# title=compromise data-link=tag>compromise</a>. Perhaps you can agree on contributing a smaller, more manageable amount to the treatment fund while still retaining enough for your cruise.</p><p><h2>Seek mediation or&nbsp;counseling.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8f2/0ac/d76e335eb189782b5bbf18dddc.jpg><p>Go on that trip. Enjoy. Forget about them. They should have sent u for that trip a long time ago with their money. If U feel guilty ask them would they sacrifice their savings to cure u if u got sick?

Sweetie, enjoy ðŸ’‹</p><p>Consider involving<strong> a </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>neutral third party</strong></a>, such as a family therapist or mediator, to help facilitate a constructive conversation between you and your son.</p><p>A professional can help both sides articulate their needs and feelings in <strong>a safe space</strong>, working towards a resolution that respects your desire for <a href=# title=happiness data-link=tag>happiness</a> and your family's need for financial support.

Unless the grandmother is taking an around the world trip, cruises are simply not that expensive and I can't believe that the money she is spending on that trip would make a discernible difference in her grandson's treatment. That would be a hard thing for me to decide, but my last cruise including airfare was somewhere around $3,500, and I wondered just what a difference this would make to a medical bill?</p><p>Suggest exploring other financial options for your grandson's treatment. This could include setting up a <strong>crowdfunding campaign, reaching out to charitable organizations, or applying for medical grants</strong>.</p><p>By <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>actively participating</strong></a><strong> in finding these solutions</strong>, you show your <strong>commitment to your grandson's well-being</strong> without having to sacrifice your long-awaited trip.</p><p><h2>Prioritize your own well-being.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d2c/494/9e453451f4a65f15f62192cc46.jpg><p>I hear a lot of compassion in your life has fallen out with your family it seems. If my baby came to ask for my help, HELP! You never know what will become at the end of the day. Many a comment nastily, I am not bashing on you. If my choice was to help my baby and or grandbaby yet I chose to say no; I personally couldn't live with myself. Helping doesn't mean you must completely drain your bank account; could you not modify your vacation into something else that you could enjoy? I would hope you could consider the sacrifice to come ask in the first place, it probably wasn't easy for them either. Did you consider that they may need it for the treatment, you didn't say if it was to be a loan or gift.</p><p>Reflect on the importance of your mental and emotional health. As a 72-year-old widow who has diligently saved for this dream trip, <strong>your </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>happiness</strong></a><strong> and well-being are also important</strong>. If you decide to prioritize your cruise,<strong> </strong>write a heartfelt letter to your son<strong> explaining your decision and your love for your grandson.</strong> Sometimes, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>maintaining your own well-being</strong></a><strong> can provide the strength needed to support others </strong>in different ways.</p><p>Remember, your decision doesn't mean you love your family any less, but rather that<strong> you also value the years of effort you've invested in your dream</strong>.</p><p>Rebecca is another mother who chose to prioritize her own well-being. When her 16-year-old pregnant daughter announced she would need help raising the baby, Rebecca refused and even asked her not to keep the child or to leave the house. This decision led to a dramatic turn of events, and <a href=#>a distressed Rebecca wrote to us for advice</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuvsSfrKydXam8br%2FAnKminpmYsm652Gafmqignrumv9Jmq6hlo5bDpnnMsmSgqpGjsbS7zWZvanFhaYNw</p></div><div id=links><a href=./1370731-janet-smollett-bio-who-matriarch-smollett-family-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Janet Smollett's bio: Who is the matriarch of the Smollett family?</a>
